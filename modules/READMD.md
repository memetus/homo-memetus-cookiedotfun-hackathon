# Homo-Memetus X Cookiedotfun DEFAI Hackathon - MODULES

> This is Homo Memetus X Cookiedotfun DEFAI Hackathon submission module respositoroy

> This repository is primarily focused on future work. We are considering additional features that will continue to rely significantly on the Cookiedotfun API even after the hackathon. Currently, we are developing modules for mindshare analysis, quantitative analysis, and sentiment analysis of projects based on data from RugChecker (which we have developed and are using internally) and various social networks. Additionally, we are analyzing collected data along with keywords from platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, and Google to create a bubble matrix, which will be used to explore and recommend tokens. While all development is currently being done in-house, we plan to rely on some features provided by Cookiedotfun, assuming that Cookiedotfun continues to support API updates.
